                <div class="self-care-content">
                    <h2>Wound, head or neck</h2>
                    <p>When the wound is checked, you may be given a tetanus immunisation.</p> 
                    <p>If the wound is still bleeding:</p> 
                    <p>Use a dry dressing or a clean cloth to make a pad and press it firmly and directly onto the wound to stop the bleeding.</p> 
                    <p>If the blood soaks through the pad, don't take it off. Place another pad on top of it and keep pressing it onto the wound.</p> 
                    <p>If you're helping someone else, try to keep their blood off your skin.</p> 
                    <p>If the wound is not bleeding: </p> 
                    <p>Cover it with a plaster, a non-stick dressing or a non-fluffy clean cloth.</p> 

                    <h2>Head injury</h2>
                    <p>A responsible adult should stay with the person with the head injury to watch out for any problems.</p>
                    <p>Paracetamol can be used to relieve pain. But, don't take it if you've been told not to, or you've already taken some. Read the instructions on the packet, or talk to a pharmacist for advice.</p>
                    <p>Don't take any other painkillers as they can cause complications following a head injury.</p>
                    <p>For any swelling:</p>
                    <p>Remove any tight clothing or jewellery from around the swelling.</p>
                    <p>Wrap an ice pack (or bag of frozen peas) in a cloth and put it on the swelling for 15-20 minutes. Repeat every 2-3 hours when you are awake.</p>
                    <p>Never put ice directly on your skin and don't leave ice on while you're asleep.</p>

                    <h2>Breathlessness, trauma</h2>
                    <p>If they are able to, let them get into a comfortable position.</p>
                    <p>If possible, support their back or hold them in an upright position.</p>

                    <h2>Worsening, head injury</h2>
                    <p>If you can't wake the person or they become dazed, groggy or have a fit, call 999..</p>
                    <p>If they have any problems understanding, speaking, balancing or walking -  call 999.</p>
                    <p>If they have any loss of feeling in any part of their body, general weakness or new deafness -  call 999.</p>
                    <p>Go straight to the nearest A&E department if they have any vomiting, changes in vision or severe headache which is getting worse.</p>
