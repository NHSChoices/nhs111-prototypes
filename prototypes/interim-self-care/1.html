                    <h2>Wound, head or neck</h2>
                    <p>A decision about whether tetanus immunisation is needed can be made when the injury is checked.</p> 
                    <p>IF THE WOUND IS STILL BLEEDING:</p> 
                    <p>Use a dry dressing or a clean cloth folded into a pad and press gently but firmly on the wound to stop the bleeding.</p> 
                    <p>If the blood soaks through the pad don't take it off. Put another pad on top of it and keep pressing on the wound.</p> 
                    <p>If helping someone else: try to keep their blood off your skin.</p> 
                    <p>IF THE WOUND IS NOT BLEEDING:</p> 
                    <p>Cover it with a plaster, a non-stick dressing or a non-fluffy clean cloth.</p> 

                                        <h2>Head injury</h2>
                    <p>A responsible adult should stay with anyone who has had a head injury to watch out for any problems.</p>
                    <p>Unless advised not to, or they have already been given, paracetamol can be used to relieve pain. Follow the instructions in the pack. If in doubt ask a pharmacist.</p>
                    <p>Don't use any other painkillers, they can cause complications following a head injury.</p>
                    <p>FOR ANY SWELLING:</p>
                    <p>Remove any jewellery or tight clothing from around the swelling.</p>
                    <p>Wrap an ice pack (or bag of frozen peas) in a cloth and put it on the area for 15-20 minutes. Repeat every 2-3 hours when awake.</p>
                    <p>Don't put ice directly on the skin. Don't leave ice on while asleep.</p>

                    <h2>Breathlessness, trauma</h2>
                    <p>If they are able to, allow them to adopt a comfortable position.</p>
                    <p>If possible, support their back or hold them in an upright position.</p>

                    <h2>Worsening, head injury</h2>
